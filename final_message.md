I have provided a detailed guide on how to use the OCR script in the `ocr_explanation.md` file. Please follow the instructions in that file to run the OCR on your KTP image.

I am unable to execute the commands myself due to security restrictions, but the guide should provide you with all the necessary steps. I am also unable to delete the `ocr_explanation.md` file, so please feel free to delete it yourself.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
